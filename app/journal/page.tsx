                  The Global Journal for Progressive Innovation & Research (GJPIR)
                  is established as a common platform for researchers working across
                  technology, management, economics, social sciences, and
                  engineering. The journal brings together four focused sections
                  that collectively support a wide spectrum of academic inquiry. We
                  aim to publish work that carries clarity, relevance, and long-term
                  value to the research community. Our approach encourages both
                  disciplinary and cross-disciplinary studies, especially those that
                  address current challenges and future possibilities. GJPIR
                  maintains a transparent review process and follows strong academic
                  ethics to ensure the reliability of the research it publishes. We
                  welcome contributions from scholars, professionals, and
                  practitioners who seek to share knowledge that can benefit
                  institutions, industries, and society. Through this journal, we
                  hope to strengthen research culture, promote meaningful dialogue,
                  and support new ideas that contribute to advancement in various
                  fields.
